## Introduction

Profiling the attention and feedforward layers in GPT-2 is crucial for understanding their performance characteristics and identifying potential bottlenecks. This repository provides an analysis of these layers, including data collection, visualization, and conclusions.

## Importance of Attention and Feedforward Layers

### Attention Layer
- Enables the model to dynamically focus on different parts of the input sequence.
- Weighs the importance of different tokens when making predictions.

### Feedforward Layer
- Processes the output of the attention mechanism through a series of transformations.
- Contributes significantly to the model's capacity to learn complex patterns.

## Profiling Techniques

We collected performance metrics across ten trials for both the attention and feedforward layers. The metrics include:
- CPI Rate (Cycles Per Instruction)
- Front-End Bound
- Back-End Bound
- Memory Bound
- Core Bound
- Bad Speculation
- Retiring

## Insights and Optimization Strategies

By calculating the average values of each metric (excluding CPI Rate) for both layers, we identified specific performance characteristics and bottlenecks.

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Reducing Front-End Bound:**
    - Improve instruction caching and prefetching.
    - Optimize code to minimize branch mispredictions.
2. **Minimizing Back-End Bound:**
    - Balance execution unit utilization and avoid hotspots.
    - Optimize memory access patterns.
3. **Addressing Memory Bound Issues:**
    - Enhance data locality and optimize memory access patterns.
    - Use memory prefetching and caching strategies.
4. **Core Bound Optimization:**
    - Optimize multi-threading and parallelism.
    - Utilize vectorized instructions.
5. **Reducing Bad Speculation:**
    - Improve branch prediction accuracy.
    - Optimize speculative execution paths.
6. **Maximizing Retiring:**
    - Optimize useful work done by the CPU.
    - Streamline the critical path of execution.
